# vv-comp-challenge-3



##

In my HTML file, you will find the structure of my static comp challenge. I did my best a structuring my containers in a way that would allow me better control over my flex design. With all of the requirements in this project, I was a little concern with my naming conventions because there is just so much. 

In my CSS file you will find all of the designs. They're are grouped in relation to the HTML so you shouldn't have a hard time finding a class.
